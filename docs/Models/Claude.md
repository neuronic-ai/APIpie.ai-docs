### **Description**

The [Claude Series](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) represents Anthropic's family of state-of-the-art large language models. These models, developed using [Constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/research), leverage cutting-edge technology to deliver exceptional performance in natural language processing, instruction-following tasks, and extended-context interactions. The models are available through various providers integrated with [APIpie's routing system](https://APIpie.ai/docs/Features/Routing).

#### **Key Features**

- **Extended Token Capacity:** Models support context lengths from 8K to 200K tokens for handling various text processing needs.
- **Multi-Provider Availability:** Accessible across platforms like [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), [EdenAI](https://www.edenai.co/), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), and [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).
- **Diverse Applications:** Optimized for chat, instruction-following, analysis, writing, and multimodal tasks.
- **Constitutional AI:** Built with advanced safety measures and ethical considerations.
- **Multimodal Capabilities:** Claude-3 models can understand and analyze images alongside text.

### Example API Call

Below is an example of how to use the [Chat Completions API](https://APIpie.ai/docs/Features/Completions) to interact with a model from the **Claude Series**, such as `claude-3-opus`.
```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://apipie.ai/v1/chat/completions' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
--data-raw '{
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "model": "claude-3-opus",
  "max_tokens": 150,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Can you explain how photosynthesis works?"
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Response Example

The expected response structure for the Claude model might look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-12345example12345",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1729535643,
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "model": "claude-3-opus",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Light Absorption**: Plants capture sunlight using chlorophyll in their leaves\n\n2. **Water and CO2**: They take in water through roots and carbon dioxide through leaf pores\n\n3. **Chemical Reaction**: Using sunlight's energy, they convert H2O and CO2 into glucose and oxygen:\n   6CO2 + 6H2O + light â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2\n\nThis process produces food for the plant and releases oxygen as a byproduct."
      },
      "logprobs": null,
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
