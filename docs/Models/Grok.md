### **Description**

The [Grok Series](https://x.ai/) represents xAI's family of state-of-the-art large language models. These models, developed by [xAI](https://x.ai/), leverage cutting-edge technology to deliver exceptional performance in natural language processing, instruction-following tasks, and multimodal interactions. Grok is known for its real-time knowledge capabilities through [X platform integration](https://twitter.com/grok) and its unique personality that combines intelligence with wit. The models are available through [APIpie's routing system](https://APIpie.ai/docs/Features/Routing).

For technical details and performance metrics, see the [Grok technical report](https://x.ai/blog/grok-os).
#### **Key Features**

- **Extended Token Capacity:** Models support context lengths up to 131K tokens for handling extensive text processing needs.
- **Multimodal Capabilities:** Vision-enabled models for processing both text and images with state-of-the-art performance.
- **Real-time Knowledge:** Access to current information through X platform integration, setting it apart from other LLMs.
- **Provider Availability:** Accessible through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).
- **Diverse Applications:** Optimized for chat, instruction-following, vision tasks, and real-time data analysis.
- **Unique Personality:** Combines factual responses with wit and humor, creating engaging interactions.

### Example API Call

Below is an example of how to use the [Chat Completions API](https://APIpie.ai/docs/Features/Completions) to interact with a model from the **Grok Series**, such as `grok-beta`.
```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://apipie.ai/v1/chat/completions' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
--data-raw '{
  "provider": "openrouter",
  "model": "grok-beta",
  "max_tokens": 150,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Can you explain how photosynthesis works?"
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Response Example

The expected response structure for the Grok model might look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-12345example12345",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1729535643,
  "provider": "openrouter",
  "model": "grok-beta",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Light Absorption**: Plants capture light energy using a pigment called chlorophyll, which is found in chloroplasts.\n\n2. **Water and Carbon Dioxide**: They absorb water through their roots and carbon dioxide from the air.\n\n3. **Glucose Production**: The light energy is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen. The equation is:\n   \n   6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2\n\nThis process provides energy for the plant and releases oxygen into the atmosphere."
      },
      "logprobs": null,
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 15,
    "completion_tokens": 125,
    "total_tokens": 140,
    "prompt_characters": 45,

### **Ethical Considerations**

The Grok models are powerful tools that should be used responsibly. Users should implement appropriate safeguards and consider potential biases in model outputs. For guidance on responsible AI usage, refer to [AI Safety Approach](https://www.safe.ai/) and [Ethical AI Guidelines](https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics). The development team maintains transparency through their open science initiative and regular safety assessments.
