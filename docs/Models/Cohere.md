### Example API Call

Below is an example of how to use the [Chat Completions API](https://APIpie.ai/docs/Features/Completions) to interact with a model from the **Cohere Series**, such as `command`.
```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://apipie.ai/v1/chat/completions' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
--data-raw '{
  "provider": "cohere",
  "model": "command",
  "max_tokens": 150,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Can you explain how photosynthesis works?"
    }
  ]
}'
```

---

### Response Example

The expected response structure for the Cohere model might look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-12345example12345",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1729535643,
  "provider": "cohere",
  "model": "command",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Light Absorption**: Plants capture light energy using a pigment called chlorophyll, which is found in chloroplasts.\n\n2. **Water and Carbon Dioxide**: They absorb water through their roots and carbon dioxide from the air.\n\n3. **Glucose Production**: The light energy is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen. The equation is:\n   \n   6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2\n\nThis process provides energy for the plant and releases oxygen into the atmosphere."
      },
      "logprobs": null,
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 15,
    "completion_tokens": 125,
    "total_tokens": 140,
    "prompt_characters": 45,
