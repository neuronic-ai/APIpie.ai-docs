### **Description**

The Hermes Series represents a collection of advanced large language models, primarily developed by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com/) and the open-source AI community. These models are fine-tuned versions built on top of powerful base models like [Llama](https://ai.meta.com/llama/), [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/), and [Mixtral](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/). The models leverage state-of-the-art [Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290) and other advanced training techniques for enhanced performance in natural language processing and instruction-following tasks. You can explore the models' technical details and training methodologies on their [Hugging Face model cards](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch). The models are available through various providers integrated with [APIpie's routing system](https://APIpie.ai/docs/Features/Routing).

#### **Key Features**

- **Extended Token Capacity:** Models support context lengths from 4K to 32K tokens for handling various text processing needs, with advanced [attention mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) for efficient processing.
- **Multi-Provider Availability:** Accessible across platforms like [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), [Together](https://www.together.ai/), and [Deepinfra](https://deepinfra.com/).
- **Diverse Applications:** Optimized for chat, instruction-following, and vision tasks through specialized [multi-task training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06646).
- **Advanced Architecture:** Built on state-of-the-art base models with specialized fine-tuning using techniques like [constitutional AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073) and [RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155).

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://apipie.ai/v1/chat/completions' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' \

### Response Example

The expected response structure for the Hermes model might look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-12345example12345",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1729535643,
  "provider": "openrouter",

    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Light Absorption**: Plants capture light energy using a pigment called chlorophyll, which is found in chloroplasts.\n\n2. **Water and Carbon Dioxide**: They absorb water through their roots and carbon dioxide from the air.\n\n3. **Glucose Production**: The light energy is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen. The equation is:\n   \n   6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2\n\nThis process provides energy for the plant and releases oxygen into the atmosphere."
