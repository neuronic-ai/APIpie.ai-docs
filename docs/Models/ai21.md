### **Description**

[AI21 Labs](https://www.ai21.com/) is a leading AI research company specializing in advanced language models. Their [Jurassic-2](https://docs.ai21.com/docs/jurassic-2-models) (J2) and [Jamba](https://www.ai21.com/jamba) series models leverage state-of-the-art technology to deliver exceptional performance in natural language processing and instruction-following tasks. The models are available through various providers integrated with [APIpie's routing system](https://APIpie.ai/docs/Features/Routing).

The Jurassic-2 series offers powerful base models optimized for enterprise use, while the Jamba series represents their latest advancement in large language models, featuring extended context windows and enhanced instruction-following capabilities. Both series are built on AI21's proprietary training techniques and architectures detailed in their [technical documentation](https://docs.ai21.com/docs/overview).

#### **Key Features**

- **Extended Token Capacity:** Models support context lengths from 8K to 256K tokens for handling various text processing needs.
- **Multi-Provider Availability:** Accessible through platforms like [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).
- **Diverse Applications:** Optimized for chat, instruction-following, and general text generation tasks.
- **Enterprise Focus:** Models designed for production-ready deployment with consistent performance and reliability.

### Example API Call

Below is an example of how to use the [Chat Completions API](https://APIpie.ai/docs/Features/Completions) to interact with a model from the **AI21 Series**, such as `jamba-instruct`.
```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://apipie.ai/v1/chat/completions' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
--data-raw '{
  "provider": "openrouter",
  "model": "jamba-instruct",
  "max_tokens": 150,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Can you explain how photosynthesis works?"
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Response Example

The expected response structure for the AI21 model might look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-12345example12345",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1729535643,
  "provider": "openrouter",
  "model": "jamba-instruct",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Light Absorption**: Plants capture light energy using a pigment called chlorophyll, which is found in chloroplasts.\n\n2. **Water and Carbon Dioxide**: They absorb water through their roots and carbon dioxide from the air.\n\n3. **Glucose Production**: The light energy is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen. The equation is:\n   \n   6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2\n\nThis process provides energy for the plant and releases oxygen into the atmosphere."
      },
      "logprobs": null,
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
