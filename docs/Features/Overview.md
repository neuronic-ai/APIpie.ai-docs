Welcome to the Features Overview for Neuronic AI's Apipie platform. We offer a cutting-edge solution for developers looking to leverage a wide variety of AI models across multiple providers, all under one API. Our platform aggregates leading AI services, including language models, image generation, voice synthesis, and embeddings, with support for hundreds of models like OpenAI, Anthropic, and ElevenLabs.

Explore the innovative features that make us stand out in the competitive landscape:

## [Models Route](https://apipie.ai/docs/Features/Models)
Easily retrieve and filter available AI models based on type, provider, and other criteria. The Models Route feature allows developers to efficiently select models tailored to their specific use cases. We provide one of the most comprehensive models route for AI services available on the market today. You will find much more than just a list of models to help you, with focus on knowledge developers need when developing or integrating with AI applications.

## [Completions](https://apipie.ai/docs/Features/Completions)
Our Chat Completions endpoint provides a powerful yet flexible way to integrate conversational AI into your applications. This route is fully compatible with OpenAI's API structure, allowing for seamless integration. You can use it to build customer support bots, creative content generation tools, or interactive experiences. Whether using a single model or leveraging our multi-model query capabilities, this endpoint allows you to tap into the power of AI with ease.

## [Integrity](https://apipie.ai/docs/Features/Integrity)
Our Integrity system minimizes AI hallucinations by querying models multiple times with an election process for selecting the most accurate response. This feature is ideal for businesses that require high accuracy in their AI outputs.

## [AI Model Pooling](https://apipie.ai/docs/Features/Pools)
Enhance reliability and reduce data exposure with AI Model Pooling. This feature aggregates similar models into pools to ensure redundancy, higher rate limits, and failover mechanisms for consistent performance. Pools could have numerous renditions of the same model or dozens of models with like capabilities. Leverage our RAG tuning with pools and you will still get a knowledgeable response regardless the underlying models training.

## [Preferred Routing](https://apipie.ai/docs/Features/Routing)
Choose between performance- or cost-optimized routing for your AI queries. Preferred Routing gives you control over how AI requests are handled across multiple providers. In the future, we will provide content-based routing that assesses the best model to use based on the content of your prompt. This will become increasingly important as different providers pay different data sources for training materials as the sector becomes more regulated.

## [Tools Support](https://apipie.ai/docs/Features/Tools)
Configure tool usage across any model we offer. Choose between OpenAI or Anthropic models to handle your tool calls inline with any request you make to any model. Tools Calls are becoming increasingly popular, and more models are picking them up natively. We will continue to expand the options in tool call providers available on our platform. Tools are commonly used as a way for AI to request additional data from your application in a format your application can depend on.

## [RAG Tuning](https://apipie.ai/docs/Features/Ragtune)
Leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance AI responses using your own data collections (one or more documents you upload to a collection). This feature provides a cost-effective alternative to training and fine-tuning models, and with larger context models, it offers similar value and accuracy with a much smaller barrier to entry. We have made it as easy as possibleâ€”upload documents to a collection, refer to the collection when you query any model we have, and it's that easy.

## [Pinecone Integration](https://apipie.ai/docs/Features/Pinecone)
For developers who want or need more control over the vectorization process, we offer full Pinecone integration, allowing you to leverage Pinecone's vector database seamlessly in your AI workflows. This gives you full control over your vector storage and retrieval, optimizing your AI responses with custom embeddings. We will also be offering other vector and vector-alternative solutions in the future.

## [Image Generation](https://apipie.ai/docs/Features/Images)
Access powerful image generation capabilities through our platform. Create, edit, and manipulate images using state-of-the-art AI models from various providers. Whether you need to generate original artwork, modify existing images, or create variations, our image generation feature provides a unified interface for all your visual AI needs.

## [Intelligent Model Management (IMM)](https://apipie.ai/docs/Features/IMM)
Our Intelligent Model Management system optimizes your AI workflow by intelligently selecting and managing models based on your specific needs. IMM considers factors like performance, cost, and capabilities to ensure you're always using the most appropriate model for each task.

## [Voice Synthesis](https://apipie.ai/docs/Features/Voices)
Transform text into natural-sounding speech with our voice synthesis feature. Create lifelike voiceovers, generate audio content, and add voice capabilities to your applications using advanced text-to-speech models from leading providers.

## [Usage](https://apipie.ai/docs/Features/Usage)
Track and analyze your API usage with unmatched transparency through our Usage feature. Apipie provides detailed insights into every API query, including token counts, response times, costs, and even source IPs. The **Historic Usage** API allows you to retrieve past query logs and audit performance, making it easier to optimize for cost-efficiency and application performance. No other provider offers this level of detailed query history accessible directly via API, empowering you to make data-driven decisions to maximize your AI integrations.

Each of these features provides a unique advantage to developers and businesses looking to implement AI solutions in their applications. Whether you are focusing on accuracy, performance, or cost-efficiency, Neuronic AI offers a comprehensive platform to meet your needs. Explore the links to dive deeper into each feature.
