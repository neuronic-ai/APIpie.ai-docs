## üîÑ How Image Generation Works

A typical API call sends a text prompt describing the desired image, along with optional parameters to control the generation process. The API then processes this input and returns either a URL to the generated image or the image data directly as a base64-encoded string, depending on your specified response format.


### Example API Call

Below is an example of how to use the Image Generation API to create an image:

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://apipie.ai/v1/images/generations' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
--data-raw '{
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "dall-e-3",
  "prompt": "A serene lake at sunset with mountains in the background",
  "n": 1,
  "size": "1024x1024",
  "quality": "standard",
  "style": "natural"
}'
```

### Response Example

The expected response structure looks like the following:

```json
{
  "created": 1729535643,
  "data": [
    {
      "url": "https://apipie.ai/temp/47g43g6f476vf.jpg",
      "revised_prompt": "A tranquil mountain lake reflecting the warm colors of sunset, with majestic peaks silhouetted against a golden sky, creating a peaceful and atmospheric natural scene"
    }
  ]
}
```

  }
}
```
Solution: Implement exponential backoff in your requests.

### Invalid Parameters
```json

    "message": "The 'size' parameter must be one of: 1024x1024, 1024x1792, 1792x1024"
  }
}
```
Solution: Verify parameter values against the documentation.

### Content Policy Violations
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "content_policy_violation",
    "message": "Your request was rejected as it violates our content policy."
  }
}
```
Solution: Review and adjust your prompt to comply with content guidelines.

### Performance Optimization Tips
